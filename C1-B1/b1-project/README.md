Mini Project: Install Ubuntu or Debian via QEMU and set up SSH access. Create a snapshot and revert to it to practice VM safety.

So I am gonna use utm. I already have an ubunto and kali vm set up on my laptop but I don't use them. I am gonna delete the old ones and load a debian distro if I can find it. I have no experience with debian so this will be fun?

So the UTM gallery has a few debian options. Debian 10.4, Debian 11 (LXDE), Debian 11(Xfce), Debian 12 (Rosetta), and Debian 12. Im gonna ask gpt for a summary of what they are and post it here

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key differences between the Debian versions and desktop environments you mentioned:

üß† Core Concepts to Know
Debian version (e.g., 10.4, 11, 12): Refers to the release of the Debian operating system. Higher numbers = newer versions.

Desktop Environment (e.g., LXDE, Xfce, Rosetta): Refers to the graphical user interface layer on top of Debian. Determines the "look and feel" and performance.

Rosetta isn't a standard DE‚Äîcontext-dependent (see below).

üßæ Version Differences
Version	Released	Status	Key Notes
Debian 10.4	May 2020	Old/stable	Part of "Buster" series; now outdated and less secure
Debian 11	Aug 2021	Older/stable	"Bullseye" release; better hardware support than 10
Debian 12	Jun 2023	Latest stable	"Bookworm"; improved security, drivers, Wayland support

üíª Desktop Environment Differences
DE	Resource Usage	Look/Feel	Target Users
LXDE	Very light	Simple, fast, old-school	Low-resource systems, performance-first users
Xfce	Light	More polished, modern	Balanced option for old/new hardware
Rosetta	‚ùì Unclear*	Unknown	Likely a custom or niche DE or build

*"Rosetta" could refer to a custom Debian remix (e.g., for translation/localization or Apple Silicon emulation via QEMU), but it's not an official Debian flavor. Could you clarify where you saw it?

üß© Which Should You Pick?
Use Case	Best Fit
Low-power VM or old laptop	Debian 11 (LXDE) or Debian 12 (Xfce)
Want up-to-date features/stability	Debian 12 (Xfce)
Learning core Debian on barebones	Debian 10.4 (no DE) if you're exploring legacy environments
Apple M-series chip via QEMU	Possibly Debian 12 (Rosetta) (context-dependent)

Would you like a side-by-side screenshot comparison of LXDE vs Xfce?

So the debian in the utm gallery is behind a internet archive log in so we're gonna try downloading it from the debian website
