Prompt to set up ssh on debian:
    - how do I set up ssh access on debian?

1. Install the openssh server
    - so when I tried sudo apt update my user doesn't have sudo power so I need to figure out what to do in that case 
    - so you switch to the root user using su - and the passwrod 
    - then run sudo apt update and sudo apt install openssh-server

2. start and enable the ssh service
    - sudo systemctl start ssh
    - sudo systemctl enable ssh

    - sudo systemctl status ssh

3. find ip address 
    - ip a
    - look for something that says inet under active ntwork interface
        - so under inet enp0s1 this is the active 

4. on another computer test ssh with ssh debianusername@serverip

5. Success!
