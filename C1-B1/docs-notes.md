Summary: So honestly this documentation is very thorough and intense. I believe it will be important down the line. One important thing I have learned is how to use UTM. It is a GUI that sits on top of QEMU and has an easy interface for loading and finding disk images. this is a link to UTM for mac https://mac.getutm.app/ it can also be found on the app store for purchase. It is a free download online but purchasing it from the app store helps support the developers.
